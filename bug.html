<p>This is a common HTML error, but it can be tricky to debug if you're not familiar with how HTML parses.</p><p>The issue is with the nested <code><p></code> tags.  HTML implicitly closes tags when it encounters a closing tag for a parent element. In this case, when the parser hits the closing <code></div></code>, it implicitly closes the inner <code><p></code> tag. However, this leads to unexpected behaviour because the remaining text is treated as part of the outer <code><p></code>, which is not semantically correct.</p><code><div><p>This is some text.</p><p>This is more text. <span>This is spanned text</span></p></div></code><p>The issue arises when you have nested <code><p></code> tags and you intend to have separate paragraphs within a container element.</p><p>Here's what happens:</p><ul><li>The browser correctly interprets <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is some text.&lt;/p&gt;</code></li><li>Then it encounters <code>&lt;p&gt;This is more text...&lt;/p&gt;</code>.  The closing <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> causes the implicit closing of the second <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</li><li>The result is that <code>This is more text. <span>This is spanned text</span></code> is treated as part of the first <code><p></code> tag which usually is not the intended behavior.</li></ul>
