<p>The solution involves using proper HTML structure. Instead of relying on implicit tag closure, explicitly close the paragraph tags before closing the outer container element. This is also improved semantically using a more appropriate div tag for the container rather than an implicit paragraph.</p><code><div><p>This is some text.</p><p>This is more text. <span>This is spanned text</span></p></div></code><p>This corrected code ensures each paragraph is properly contained and closed, preventing the unexpected rendering behavior.</p>
